#What is this Repo

This repo is an easy and quick way to get an angular site running. It uses AngularJS and its UI-Router for the front end and NodeJS/ExpressJS for the backend.
Gulp is used to compile SCSS, to transpile ES6 JS and minify it along with HTML and allow for livereloading.
It is essientially a very simple version of the MEAN stack without MongoDB.
