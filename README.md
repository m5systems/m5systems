#What is this repo

This repo is an easy and quick way to get angular running. It uses AngularJS and its UI-Router for the front end and NodeJS/ExpressJS for the backend.
Gulp is used to compile SCSS, to transpile ES6 JS and minify it along with HTML and allow for livereloading.
It is essientially the MEAN stack but without the MongoDB.
