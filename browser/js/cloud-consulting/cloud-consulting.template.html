		<h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
		<div>
			<h4>Security</h4>
			<p>Security best practices should not be thrown away when you move to the Cloud. They should be the same as your current premise Data Center.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>Adaption</h4>
			<p>How is my organization going to adapt to the cloud? How do I properly support it? What does this mean to my Data Center?</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>Efficiency</h4>
			<p>Agility only comes with taking advantage of the cloud’s automation and scalability capabilities</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>TCO</h4>
			<p>Cost savings will come only by adapting to the “Cloud Paradigm”. Customers must must make their cloud services decisions like their traditional data center ones with ”open eyes”</p>
